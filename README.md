'ether-twitter' allows anyone to\
**without metamask**
* read all tweets

**with metamask**
* post tweets oneself
* edit own tweets
* delete own tweets

**additional features**
* Users without a connected account have the 'Tweet' button disabled
* Metamask users on the wrong network, will be prompted to switch to the Goerli Testnet
* Connected Users can ONLY delete and/or edit their OWN tweets
* 'Edited' label to edited tweets
* Age of tweet is shown

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case, containing
* a sample contract
* a test for the contract

## Difficulties & Solutions
* **Delete Function**: \
As nothing can be deleted from blockchain, coming up with a way to deleting a tweet was not intuitive. Therefore, instead of deleting from the tweets array, we have created a boolean for each tweet that gets flagged when the user wants to delete a tweet meanwhile not displaying it on the frontend.

* **OnlyOwner Identifier**: \
At first we thought of using OwnlyOwner identifier to allow only the owner of a tweet to delete or edit one's tweet. However, the bahvior was different than expected. Instead, we save the address of the initial sender within the Tweet Structure, and compare that upon delete / edit request.

* **Imbalance Research & Code to write**: \
In the beginning, the project felt complicated as none of us had experiences with contracts or ethereum. As such, all member underwent extensive research before starting to code. However, once we started coding, we discovered it was fairly little work to partition among 4 members.

## Conclusion
Looking back, our team invested more time on doing research and tutorials than coding. We are positive that we all have grasped a deeper understanding on ethereum.

We have a dedicated Readme for the Front End! Check it out at [ether-twitter/front-end](https://github.com/martinsejas/Blockchain-Twitter/tree/main/front-end)
